		<h1>Tarantulas</h1>
		<hr>
		
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Tarantulas are spiders but bigger. The biggest tarantula has a body that is 4.75 inches long with an 11 inch leg span. 
			Those tarantulas are Goliath bird eating tarantulas. Currently there are 1,040 species of tarantula that have been 
			identified. Tarantulas are also nocturnal
		</p>
		<hr>
		
		<h2>General Information</h2> 
		<p>Tarantula babies are commonly referred to as slings. They are under 2 inches big and can start out at under a 1/2 inch. 
			Tarantulas typically eat crickets and mealworms, especially in captivity, but eat many other prey as well. They only need 
			to eat 1 or twice every week or two and can go a whole year without eating and still be alive as long as they are kept well
			hydrated.
		</p>

		<h2>How do they move?</h2>
		<p>The way that tarantulas legs work is almost completely opposite of how our muscles work. Their legs start out contracted and 
			they use their hemolmphs (their blood equivalent) to stretch out their legs (hydraulics). This is why when tarantulas 
			(and other spiders) die they die in a tight curl instead of limp and flat.
		</p>

		<h2>Molting</h2>
		<p>Depending on what point of their life they are in, tarantulas do a lot of molting. While they are young they molt around once a month,
			while older tarantulas molt every year or two. However, only female tarantulas can molt after maturity, male tarantulas die before 
			they can molt after maturity.</p>
		<hr>
		
		<h2>New World vs. Old World</h2>
		<p>New world tarantulas are from the western hemisphere and old world are from the eastern hemisphere. Old world and new world 
			tarantulas have a lot of differences in behavior and physique. Old word are fast, less hair, and tend to be more aggressive, and 
			with worse venom. New world are a lot slower, more hairy, and have venom comparable to a bee sting. New world tarantulas have hairs 
			called urticating hairs, which is a defense mechanism where they kick hairs into the air that cause irritation to potential predators.</p>
		
		<h3>TLDR:</h3>
		<p>New World Traits:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>From the Western Hemisphere</li>
			<li>Slower</li>
			<li>More Hairy</li>
			<li>Weaker Venom</li>
			<li>Urticating Hairs</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Old World Traits:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>From the Eastern Hemisphere</li>
			<li>Faster</li>
			<li>Less Hair</li>
			<li>Stronger Venom</li>
			<li>No Urticating Hairs</li>
		</ul>
